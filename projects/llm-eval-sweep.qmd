# LLM Evaluation with Weights & Biases Sweeps

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-181717?logo=github)](https://github.com/ayulockin/llm-eval-sweep)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates systematic approaches to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) using Weights & Biases Sweeps. It provides practical examples of how to set up comprehensive evaluation pipelines for different types of LLM tasks.

## Key Features

1. **QA Evaluation**: Framework for evaluating question-answering performance
2. **Mathematical Reasoning**: Specialized evaluation for mathematical problem solving
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Using W&B Sweeps to find optimal prompting strategies
4. **Visualization**: Rich visual analytics for interpreting results

## Implementation Details

The repository implements several evaluation strategies:

### LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

One of the most powerful approaches is using another LLM (typically a more capable one) to evaluate the responses of the target LLM:

```python
def evaluate_with_llm_judge(question, reference_answer, model_response):
    """
    Uses a judge LLM to evaluate the quality of a model response
    compared to a reference answer.
    """
    judge_prompt = f"""
    Question: {question}
    Reference Answer: {reference_answer}
    Model Response: {model_response}
    
    Evaluate the model response on the following criteria on a scale of 1-10:
    1. Accuracy: How factually correct is the response?
    2. Completeness: How complete is the response?
    3. Relevance: How relevant is the response to the question?
    
    For each criterion, provide a score and a brief explanation.
    Finally, provide an overall score.
    """
    
    # Call the judge LLM
    evaluation = judge_llm(judge_prompt)
    
    # Parse the scores from the evaluation
    # Implementation depends on the structure of the judge's response
    
    return parsed_scores
```

### Sweep Configuration

The project uses W&B Sweeps to systematically explore different parameters:

```python
sweep_config = {
    "method": "grid",
    "metric": {"name": "average_accuracy", "goal": "maximize"},
    "parameters": {
        "temperature": {"values": [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0]},
        "prompt_strategy": {"values": ["direct", "cot", "few_shot"]},
        "max_tokens": {"values": [100, 200, 500]},
    }
}
```

This allows exploration of how different combinations of temperature, prompting strategies, and token limits affect the model's performance.

## Results and Insights

The repository includes visualizations of sweep results, demonstrating how different parameters affect various performance metrics:

- **Temperature Impact**: Lower temperatures generally improved factual accuracy but sometimes at the cost of completeness
- **Prompt Strategies**: Chain-of-Thought prompting significantly improved mathematical reasoning tasks
- **Parameter Interaction**: Complex interactions between parameters highlighted the importance of systematic sweeps rather than one-at-a-time optimization

## Practical Applications

This evaluation framework can be applied to:

1. **Model Selection**: Comparing different LLMs for specific use cases
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Finding optimal prompting strategies
3. **Fine-tuning Decisions**: Determining whether fine-tuning would benefit specific tasks
4. **Application Development**: Building more robust LLM-powered applications

## Future Work

Ongoing and planned improvements include:

- Adding support for more diverse evaluation tasks
- Implementing automated evaluation for creative and open-ended generation
- Integrating human feedback into the evaluation pipeline
- Exploring adaptive evaluation strategies that adjust to model strengths and weaknesses

## Get Started
