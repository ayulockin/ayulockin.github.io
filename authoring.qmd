# Authoring

Below are the blogs, articles, and tutorials I have written on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and MLOps. I am fortunate to collaborate with many talented individuals globally and share my knowledge with the community.

## Collaborative Work

I enjoy collaborating with other practitioners in the field:

* **Open Source Contributions**: I build MLOps pipelines for popular repositories like Keras, OpenMMLab, and Meta
* **Technical Reviews**: I provide technical reviews for ML/DL content published by various platforms
