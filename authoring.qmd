# Authoring

Below are the blogs, articles, and tutorials I have written on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and MLOps. I am fortunate to collaborate with many talented individuals globally and share my knowledge with the community.

* [Training with Mixed Precision in TensorFlow 2.0](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/training-with-mixed-precision-in-tensorflow-2-0-7a18a42f5eff)

## Tutorials & Guides

I've created in-depth tutorials on various ML/DL topics:

* [TensorFlow Implementation of SwAV](https://github.com/ayulockin/SwAV-TF) - GitHub repository with detailed notebooks
* [LLM Evaluation Strategies](https://github.com/ayulockin/llm-eval-sweep) - Repository demonstrating systematic LLM evaluation approaches
* [E2E MLOps Pipeline on GCP for Tensorflow](https://github.com/ayulockin/e2e-mlops-pipeline-on-gcp-for-tensorflow) - End-to-end MLOps on Google Cloud Platform

## Collaborative Work

I enjoy collaborating with other practitioners in the field:

* **Open Source Contributions**: I build MLOps pipelines for popular repositories like Keras, OpenMMLab, and Meta
* **Technical Reviews**: I provide technical reviews for ML/DL content published by various platforms
