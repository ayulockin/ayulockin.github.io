Hello! I'm an engineer by choice and heart and I love solving problems. I am not married to any school of engineering and love learning about varying technologies. I am also an active learner of biology and physics.

I have a **background in Electronics and Communication Engineering**. I haven't pursued electronics in a while now in pursuit of ML but in past life have actively built autonomous robots. I feel equipped now to merge both domains of engineering to solve "big" problems.

Professionally, I am an **AI Engineer at Weights and Biases (by CoreWeave)**. I lead our open source integration efforts primarily. These integrations make it easy for you ML practitioners to get an MLOps stack. Currently I am specializing in building LLM applications and doing model evaluations. But over the span of 5 years at W&B, I have worn multiple hats -- like leading our Kaggle initiatives, building our most popular courses, and a ton loads of reports that SEO really well. Overall, the technical efforts have contributed to a successful merger of W&B with CoreWeave and I have big plans.

I am also a **Google Developer Expert** in Machine Learning and a **Kaggle Master** (notebook).

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!) and sharing knowledge through technical articles. I have started with 3D printing as well. Stay tuned!

Know more about me from [here](about.html). My external articles and other work are listed [here](authoring.html). A detailed account of my projects can be found [here](projects.html).

## News

* New work on RAG evaluation: [RAG Techniques: From Naive to Advanced](https://wandb.ai/site/articles/rag-techniques/) - a comprehensive guide to Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques.
* New work: [LLM Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/ayulockin/llm-eval-sweep) with systematic evaluation approaches using W&B Sweeps.
* New work: [Building MLOps pipelines for Keras](https://keras.io/) integration with comprehensive monitoring and tracking capabilities.
* Gave a course on **RAG++: From POC to Production** covering practical implementation strategies. Find the materials [here](authoring.html).
* Open-sourced [SwAV-TF](https://github.com/ayulockin/SwAV-TF), a TensorFlow implementation of self-supervised visual representation learning.

To know more about my projects, please refer to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/ayulockin).

Apart from the work [here](authoring.html), I try to contribute to other platforms in the form of writing and open-source contributions. Please refer [here](authoring.html) for more details.
