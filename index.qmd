Hi, I’m Ayush — an engineer who loves building, learning, and solving complex problems. I’m driven by curiosity rather than allegiance to any single discipline, which has led me to explore everything from electronics to machine learning, biology, and physics.

I hold a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. While my focus has shifted from circuits to code, my early work on autonomous robots gave me a strong foundation in systems thinking — something I now bring to my work in AI. My goal is to bridge these domains to tackle problems that truly matter.

I currently work as a **Manager, AI Engineer** at **Weights & Biases** (now part of CoreWeave), where I lead our open source integration efforts. These projects help machine learning practitioners easily build complete MLOps stacks. Over my 5 years at W&B, I’ve specialized in LLM application development and model evaluation, while also leading Kaggle initiatives, creating popular courses, and producing technical reports that drive visibility and growth.

I’m also a **Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning** and a **Kaggle Master** (Notebooks).

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!) and sharing knowledge through technical articles. I have started with 3D printing as well. Stay tuned!

Know more about me from [here](about.html). My external articles and other work are listed [here](authoring.html). A detailed account of my projects can be found [here](projects.html).
