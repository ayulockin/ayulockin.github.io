Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Ayush Thakur. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) specializing in LLM applications, model evaluation, and MLOps. I lead the AI team in India and the OS integration efforts. Know more about me from [here](/about/).

I develop MLOps solutions for popular repositories like [Keras](https://keras.io/), [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/), and others from Meta. I've also built integrations with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) (fine-tuning and chat completions), [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) and more.

My external articles and other work are listed [here](/authoring/). A detailed account of my projects can be found [here](/projects/).

These days I am exploring agents and MCPs.

I'm a **Google Developer Expert** in Machine Learning and a **Kaggle Notebooks Master**. When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!) and sharing knowledge through technical articles.

## News

* New work on RAG evaluation: [RAG Techniques: From Naive to Advanced](https://wandb.ai/site/articles/rag-techniques/) - a comprehensive guide to Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques.
* New work: [LLM Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/ayulockin/llm-eval-sweep) with systematic evaluation approaches using W&B Sweeps.
* New work: [Building MLOps pipelines for Keras](https://keras.io/) integration with comprehensive monitoring and tracking capabilities.
* Gave a course on **RAG++: From POC to Production** covering practical implementation strategies. Find the materials [here](/authoring/).
* Open-sourced [SwAV-TF](https://github.com/ayulockin/SwAV-TF), a TensorFlow implementation of self-supervised visual representation learning.

To know more about my projects, please refer to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/ayulockin).

Apart from the work [here](/authoring/), I try to contribute to other platforms in the form of writing and open-source contributions. Please refer [here](/authoring/) for more details.
