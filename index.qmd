Hello! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in LLM applications, model evaluation, and MLOps. I lead the AI team in India and lead the OS integration efforts. My work focuses on baking MLOps pipelines for open-source repositories, building W&B Weave enabled tracing and monitoring, evaluating LLM systems, and developing educational content for the open-source community. Most of my work can be found in the [Authoring](/authoring/){target="_blank"} section.

I have developed MLOps solutions for popular repositories like Keras, OpenMMLab, few from Meta and more. I have also built integrations with OpenAI (fine-tuning and chat completions), Cohere, CrewAI and more.

These days I am exploring agents and MCPs. 

I'm also a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning and a Kaggle Notebooks Master.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!), sharing knowledge through technical articles, and collaborating on interesting ML projects.
