::: {.profile-bio}
Hello! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in LLM applications, model evaluation, and MLOps. My work focuses on building robust ML pipelines, evaluating LLM systems, and developing tools for the open-source community.

At Weights & Biases, I develop MLOps solutions for popular repositories like Keras, OpenMMLab, and Meta. I'm also a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning and a Kaggle Notebooks Master.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!), sharing knowledge through technical articles, and collaborating on interesting ML projects.
