I'm an engineer driven by curiosity—exploring machine learning, AI systems, and the hard problems that sit at their intersection.

I work as **Manager, AI Engineer** at **Weights & Biases** (now part of CoreWeave), leading open-source integrations that help ML practitioners build complete MLOps stacks. Over five years at W&B, I've specialized in LLM applications and evaluation, created courses, and written extensively about what I've learned.

I'm a **Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning** and a **Kaggle Notebooks Master**.

When I'm not working, I watch anime, think about hard problems, and occasionally 3D print things.
