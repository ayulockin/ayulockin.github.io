::: {.profile-bio}
Hello! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in LLM applications, model evaluation, and MLOps. I lead the AI team in India and the OS integration efforts at W&B. My work focuses on building MLOps pipelines for open-source repositories, developing LLM integrations with providers like OpenAI and Cohere, and creating educational content.

I've built integrations for popular repositories like Keras, OpenMMLab, and Meta. I've also developed comprehensive courses on RAG systems and LLM fine-tuning.

Currently exploring agents and MCPs. When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime (Naruto is my all-time favorite!) and sharing knowledge through technical articles.
