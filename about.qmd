## Hello, I'm Ayush Thakur ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as Manager, AI Engineering at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) by CoreWeave, leading a small team of awesome AI Engineers. We focus on bringing down the entry of barrier to have an MLOps or LLMOps stack into a framework of your choice by building integrations, writing docs, creating educational content, and more.
