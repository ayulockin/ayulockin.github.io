## Background

I'm an engineer who loves building, learning, and solving complex problems. I'm driven by curiosity rather than allegiance to any single discipline—electronics, machine learning, biology, physics—whatever the problem demands.

I hold a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My early work on autonomous robots gave me a foundation in systems thinking that I now bring to AI.
