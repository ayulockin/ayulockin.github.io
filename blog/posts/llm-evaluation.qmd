# A Practical Guide to LLM Evaluation

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, robust evaluation becomes essential. It's not enough to simply deploy an LLM and hope for the best â€“ we need systematic ways to assess their performance across multiple dimensions.

In this article, I'll share a practical approach to LLM evaluation, drawing from my experience building evaluation pipelines with Weights & Biases Sweeps.

## Why LLM Evaluation is Challenging

Unlike traditional ML models where metrics like accuracy or F1 score might suffice, LLMs present unique evaluation challenges:

1. **Multiple dimensions of quality**: From factual accuracy to coherence to safety
2. **Context sensitivity**: Performance can vary dramatically across different topics and scenarios
3. **Subjectivity**: Many aspects of LLM outputs require human judgment
4. **Rapid evolution**: Evaluation frameworks need to keep pace with rapidly advancing capabilities

## Building a Systematic Evaluation Framework

A comprehensive LLM evaluation framework should include:

### 1. Clearly Defined Evaluation Dimensions

Some important dimensions to consider:

- **Factual accuracy**: Does the LLM provide correct information?
- **Relevance**: Does the response address the query appropriately?
- **Coherence**: Is the response logically structured and consistent?
- **Conciseness**: Does the response avoid unnecessary verbosity?
- **Safety**: Does the model avoid harmful, unethical, or biased outputs?
- **Format adherence**: Does the output follow requested formats?

### 2. Reference Datasets

For effective evaluation, you need appropriate datasets:

- **Benchmark datasets**: Standard datasets like MMLU, HumanEval, etc., for comparative evaluation
- **Domain-specific datasets**: Tailored to your application area
- **Adversarial examples**: Test cases designed to probe specific weaknesses
- **Real-world examples**: Actual queries from your target use case

### 3. Evaluation Methods

Different aspects of LLM performance require different evaluation strategies:

#### Automated Evaluation

- **Reference-based metrics**: Compare against ground truth using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, etc.
- **Model-based evaluation**: Use another LLM (often a more powerful one) to evaluate outputs
- **Rule-based checkers**: Verify specific constraints (e.g., format validation)

#### Human Evaluation

- **Expert review**: Domain experts assess specific aspects
- **Comparative ranking**: Side-by-side comparison of different models
- **User feedback**: Real-world user reactions and preferences

## Implementing Evaluation with Weights & Biases Sweeps

Let's look at how we can implement systematic LLM evaluation using W&B Sweeps.

### Setting Up the Evaluation Framework

Here's a simplified approach from my [llm-eval-sweep](https://github.com/ayulockin/llm-eval-sweep) repository:

```python
import wandb
from wandb.sdk.data_types import WeightsTable

# Initialize W&B run
run = wandb.init(project="llm-evaluation")

# Define a simple dataset for QA evaluation
qa_pairs = [
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "reference": "Paris"},
    {"question": "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?", "reference": "William Shakespeare"},
    # More examples...
]

# Define LLM function (could be OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other provider)
def get_llm_response(question, temperature, max_tokens):
    # Implementation depends on your LLM provider
    return "Sample response"

# Track model outputs and evaluations
eval_table = wandb.Table(columns=["question", "reference", "response", 
                                 "accuracy_score", "relevance_score"])

# Calculate scores using another LLM as judge
def evaluate_response(question, reference, response):
    # Implementation of LLM-as-judge
    return {"accuracy": 0.85, "relevance": 0.9}

# Run evaluation for each example
for qa in qa_pairs:
    response = get_llm_response(
        qa["question"], 
        temperature=0.7, 
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    scores = evaluate_response(qa["question"], qa["reference"], response)
    
    eval_table.add_data(
        qa["question"],
        qa["reference"],
        response,
        scores["accuracy"],
        scores["relevance"]
    )

# Log the evaluation results
wandb.log({"evaluations": eval_table})
```

### Optimizing with W&B Sweeps

The real power comes when we use Sweeps to systematically explore different prompt strategies and model parameters:

```python
sweep_configuration = {
    "method": "grid",
    "parameters": {
        "temperature": {"values": [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0]},
        "prompt_template": {
            "values": [
                "Answer the following question: {question}",
                "Given the question '{question}', provide a concise answer.",
                "Answer this question accurately and briefly: {question}"
            ]
        },
        "max_tokens": {"values": [50, 100, 200]}
    }
}

sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_configuration, project="llm-evaluation")

def sweep_function():
    run = wandb.init()
    
    # Get sweep parameters
    temperature = wandb.config.temperature
    prompt_template = wandb.config.prompt_template
    max_tokens = wandb.config.max_tokens
    
    # Run evaluation with these parameters
    # ... similar to previous code, but using sweep parameters
    
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=sweep_function)
```

This approach allows us to systematically explore the impact of different parameters on model performance, and visualize the results in the W&B UI.

## Case Study: Math Problem Evaluation

One interesting application of this approach is evaluating LLM performance on mathematical problems.

For mathematical problems, we might define specialized evaluation dimensions:

1. **Correctness of final answer**
2. **Validity of the solution approach**
3. **Step-by-step reasoning quality**

Here's how we might adapt our evaluation framework:

```python
math_problems = [
    {
        "question": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15",
        "reference_answer": "x = 5",
        "reference_solution": "2x + 5 = 15\n2x = 10\nx = 5"
    },
    # More problems...
]

# Define specialized math evaluation
def evaluate_math_solution(problem, reference_answer, reference_solution, response):
    # Extract final answer from the response
    # Analyze solution approach
    # Score step-by-step reasoning
    return {
        "answer_correctness": 1.0,  # Binary or graded
        "approach_validity": 0.9,   # How valid was the solution approach
        "reasoning_quality": 0.8    # Quality of intermediate steps
    }
```

## Visualizing and Interpreting Results

After running our evaluations, W&B gives us powerful visualization capabilities:

1. **Parallel coordinates plots**: See how different parameters affect various metrics
2. **Scatter plots**: Identify relationships between different evaluation dimensions
3. **Tables with rich media**: Examine individual examples with detailed scoring

These visualizations help identify:

- **Patterns of failure**: Common scenarios where the model struggles
- **Parameter sensitivity**: How temperature, prompt structure, etc. affect performance
- **Trade-offs**: Where improving one metric might harm another

## Conclusion

Effective LLM evaluation requires a systematic approach that addresses multiple dimensions of performance. By using tools like W&B Sweeps, we can:

1. Define clear evaluation criteria
2. Test across diverse examples
3. Systematically explore different parameters
4. Visualize and analyze results

This approach not only helps in selecting the right models and parameters but also in identifying specific weaknesses that need addressing.

Remember that evaluation is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. As your use cases evolve and models improve, your evaluation framework should evolve too.
